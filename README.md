# 🚀 Reward Tracker Backend

## Project Description

Reward Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed to allow credit card users to take full control of their financial benefits. In an era of complex reward structures, this platform solves the challenge of managing multiple cards by providing a centralized, manual logging system for transactions.

The application serves three primary purposes:

Centralized Tracking: Users can manually log transactions to monitor specific category spendings and reward progress across various credit cards.

Benefit Optimization: helping user track annual fees, statement credits, and milestone rewards.

Community Insight: Through an integrated forum, users can exchange tips, share "hidden" card benefits, and discuss financial strategies with a like-minded community.
